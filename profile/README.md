# **[Bangkit 2023] C22-PS087 Product-Based Capstone Project**
Our project aims to develop an application that promotes mental clarity and emotional well-being. The app will consist of several key features, including a journaling ChatBot, and a collection of soothing music for stress management. By addressing common mental challenges such as stress, anxiety, and overthinking, our application will provide users with practical tools and resources to improve their overall mental well-being. 
The project plan was executed in a structured manner, with the MD team taking charge of the UI design of the application, while the CC team planned the services to be used. The ML team was responsible for building the ChatBot model, which was then handed over to the CC team for deployment. The CC team began by creating an API that would allow users to register logins, as well as another API that would fetch store data for the Bedtime Story feature. The MD team then made use of the endpoint provided by the CC team. Finally, the ChatBot model was deployed to Google Cloud by the CC team, with the endpoint being handed over to the MD team.
